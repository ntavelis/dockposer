# PHP FPM docker file, creates the php-fpm docker image that will be used from your application
# There are some marked sections inside this dockerfile, that begin and end with `###> %s ###`
# These marked sections are handled by dockposer, if you remove them, then simply dockposer will not update them anymore

# You are free to do whatever you want outside the marked sections
# Feel free to edit this file
# Just remember if you delete the marked sections then you will have to maintain them on your own
